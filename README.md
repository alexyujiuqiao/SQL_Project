# SQL Project
This repository provides a comprehensive example of data analysis work focused on recording and analyzing daily dietary data using SQL. The project aims to help users better understand their eating habits and nutritional intake by leveraging SQL for data management, analysis, and visualization.

### Project Purpose
- To record and analyze daily dietary data to better understand eating habits and nutritional intake.
- Establish a structured database to log users' food intake, meals, and nutritional information.
- Utilize SQL queries and data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and trends in dietary habits.
- Calculate and evaluate daily consumption of calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients against personalized dietary goals.

### Main Features
- Data Import: Import dietary records from various data sources (`Food_Menu.csv`).
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
- Data Analysis: Calculate daily intake of calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Extend analysis to vitamins and minerals if data is available. Further analyze changes in dietary habits over weeks or months, and compare with the daily diet goals.
- Data Visualization: Generate charts and reports to display dietary trends and nutritional intake.
